## üõ†Ô∏è End-to-End SEO Audit Queue Flow

This project uses a job queue (BullMQ + Redis) to handle SEO audits asynchronously. Here‚Äôs how the flow works:

### 1. Trigger from Frontend
- The frontend sends a POST request to the API endpoint `/api/seo/audit` with a JSON body containing `url` and `userId`.

### 2. Express Route Enqueues Job
- The Express route receives the request and calls `enqueueAuditJob`, which adds the job to the Bull queue (backed by Redis).

### 3. Worker Processes Job
- A separate worker process (`npm run dev:worker`) listens for jobs on the queue.
- When a job is available, the worker calls `performSeoAudit` to process the audit.

### 4. Persist Audit Results
- After the audit is complete, the result is saved in MongoDB using the `AuditResult` model.
- Results can later be fetched and displayed in the frontend.

#### Example Usage

**POST /api/seo/audit**
```json
{
  "url": "https://example.com",
  "userId": "user-123"
}
```

#### Testing the Flow
1. Start your Express server: `npm run dev`
2. Start your worker: `npm run dev:worker`
3. Send a POST request to `/api/seo/audit` with a valid `url` and `userId`.
4. Check your worker logs for processing messages.
5. Verify that the audit result is saved in MongoDB.
